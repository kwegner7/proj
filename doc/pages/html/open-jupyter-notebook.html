  How To Open a CSV File in a Jupyter Notebook</h3>

<br>

<p>
  It is required that Anaconda Navigator be installed on your PC.
</p>

<p class="shift green">
  In the search window at lower left, type "anaconda"<br>
  Select "Anaconda Powershell Prompt"<br>
</p>

<p>
  Specify the location of the <em>"apps"</em> folder:
</p>

<p class="shift green">
  $APPS = "C:\res\code\apps"
</p>

<p>
  There is a "jupyter" folder containing a "data" folder. This is a useful
  place to store the CSV files.<br><br>
  Type the following commands:
</p>

<p class="shift green">
  set-location $APPS/jupyter<br>
  jupyter notebook AirDepth.ipynb<br>
  Pull down "Kernel" and select Restart & Run All"
</p>

<p>
  These are the meanings of each column:
</p>

<div class="shift green">

<dl style="margin:0 30% 0 2%">
<dt>x1, y1, z1</dt>
<dd>The 3D Cartesian coordinates of the burst with origin on the surface of the earth. The x coordinate is the horizontal, the y coordinate is the depth and the z coordinate is the vertical component. Units are feet.</dd>
<dt>x2, y2, z2</dt>
<dd>The 3D Cartesian coordinates of the receiver with origin on the surface of the earth. The x coordinate is the horizontal, the y coordinate is the depth and the z coordinate is the vertical component. Units are feet.</dd>
<dt>alt1, alt2</dt>
<dd>The altitudes of the burst and receiver. The altitude is greater than or equal to the z coordinate because of the curvature of the earth. Units are feet.</dd>
<dt>horiz, vert</dt>
<dd>The horizontal and vertical offsets from the burst to the receiver. Units are feet.</dd>
<dt>slant</dt>
<dd>The slant range from the burst to the receiver. Units are feet.</dd>
<dt>angle</dt>
<dd>The angle of the burst to the receiver. Units are degrees. This angle is measured from the horizontal plane containing the burst location.</dd>
<dt>density1, density2</dt>
<dd>The air densities of the burst and receiver at alt1 and alt2. Units are grams per centimeter cubed.</dd>
<dt>rhor</dt>
<dd>The air depth (rhor) between the burst and receiver. Units are grams per centimeter squared.</dd>
</dl>
</div>


<p>
  Under the heading "Open a CSV File", you can specify any CSV file in the data folder:
</p>

<p class="shift green">
  res = pd.read_csv('data/ballistic7.csv')
</p>
